### Synapsis:
A artifical inteligence that plays the popular mobile game, Flappy Bird. Utilizing the structure of my neural network library, and a genetic algorithm to breed advanced Flappy Birds capable of navigating the pipes. Written in Java utilizing the Java Processing library for graphics and .net window management.

### Features:
* Neural Network
* Fixed Topology
* Genetic evolutionary training algorithm
* Processing Graphics

### Difficulties:
* Designing a Flappy Bird game in Java Processing
* Creating non-square accurate collision detection
* Tuning evolution parameters and determining neural network topology
