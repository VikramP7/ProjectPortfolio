# Java Neural Network Library

**August 2021**

___

### Synapsis:
Neural network library that I wrote from scratch as an interesting intersection between matrix mathematics, linear algebra, multi-variable calculus and programming. This was a summer project before grade 10 as a hobby. However ended up being used as my Math IB paper topic. 


### Features:
* Multi-layer
* Dynamicly defined topology
* Dynamic normalization function activation
* Multiple learning structures

### Difficulties:
* Understanding the mathematics enough to convert it into functioning java code
* Building the project from scratch, meaning no prebuilt libraries to rely on. (A blessing and a curse, as I had to understand every line I wrote)
* Debuging a neural network is imposible as it is hard to determine if it is operating properly
